            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I'm a front-end developer with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
                Iâ€™ve worked with frameworks like React and Angular, and I enjoy building clean, responsive, and
                user-friendly web interfaces.
                Always curious to learn new tools and improve my skills.</p>
